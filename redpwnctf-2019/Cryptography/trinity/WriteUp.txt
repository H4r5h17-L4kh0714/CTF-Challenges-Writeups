The encryption script is first encoding the flag with morse code, then it is substituting the dots and dashes with numbers.
We have to reverse the dictionaries and then use them in the functions and reverse the order of the functions to get the flag. 
You can use Solution Script.py for solving it.
This will give you the flag: ternaryismorearcanebutibetyouthoughtofitfirst
