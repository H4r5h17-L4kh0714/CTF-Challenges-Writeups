Analysis:
From the challenge description, we know that the flag length is 25.
And from the attachments we have the cipher in output.txt and the encryption code in chall2_3f321844-aa2d-4b6a-82b4-d2a5ddb61d5b.py.
From the encryption code, we can figure out that the plaintext is divided into blocks of length 16.
Each block is XORed with a random single byte.
The random single byte is in the range of 256.

Solution:
So, we can convert the given hexstring to bytes and then seperate them into blocks of 16 bytes each.

Then bruteforce the single byte used for every block and check if the flag format exists in the plaintext.
