Let's go step by step:

Download the challenge attachment, LOL ðŸ¤£

Use exiftool on the image - $ exiftool </path/to/image>

Notice the comment which you see, keep it in mind :)

Now use binwalk to extract the files hidden in the image - $ binwalk -e </path/to/image>

Now, when you see the files in the directory, you will see another extracted folder.

Open the folder, you will see its contents.

If you open flag.txt, you will see that the file is empty. So let's focus on the 9CB0.zip file.

Now if we try to unzip it, it will ask for a password.

Now, remember the comment which we got when we used exiftool on the image ??

Use that as the password.

Now it will ask to replace flag.txt, allow it to replace.

Now, just open the new flag.txt and you will get the flag :)

Thanks for reading :)
